# Introduction
In todayâ€™s competitive job market, companies receive thousands of resumes for various positions. Manually reviewing these resumes is time-consuming and prone to human bias.

This project introduces an AI-Powered Resume Classifier that automatically analyzes resumes in PDF format, extracts the text, and classifies them into predefined categories using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The system is deployed with an interactive Streamlit application, allowing users to upload resumes and instantly receive classification results with probabilities for different categories
