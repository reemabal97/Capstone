## üìå Introduction  
This project, **Multilingual Resume Classification using Large Language Models (LLMs)**, focuses on automatically classifying resumes (CVs) into professional job categories.  
The main motivation is twofold:  
1. The need for automation in HR systems to process thousands of resumes efficiently.  
2. The challenge of handling multilingual resumes in both English and Arabic.  

The dataset consists of:  
- English CV dataset (~6800 samples)  
- Arabic CV dataset (~6800 samples)  

Both datasets were cleaned, normalized, and preprocessed before modeling.

## üöÄ Features  
- Supports English & Arabic resumes.  
- Fine-tuned DistilBERT (English) & AraBERT-mini (Arabic).  
- Interactive Streamlit app for real-time classification.  
- Handles PDF, DOCX, and TXT uploads.  
- WordCloud visualizations with full Arabic support (reshaping & bidi).  
- Fully documented training pipeline (Jupyter Notebook).

## ‚úÖ Results & Conclusion  
This project successfully built LLM-based systems for multilingual resume classification.  

- The English DistilBERT model achieved strong accuracy on the evaluation set.  
- The Arabic AraBERT-mini model performed effectively with smaller datasets when combined with preprocessing.  
- WordCloud visualizations were generated for both languages, ensuring correct Arabic rendering.  

### Key findings:  
- Transfer learning (DistilBERT, AraBERT) outperforms traditional ML baselines.  
- Preprocessing (reshaping, bidi, font embedding) is essential for Arabic NLP.  
- Streamlit deployment makes the system interactive and easy to extend.  

### Future extensions:  
- Expanding with a larger, more diverse dataset.  
- Enhancing performance with data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.  
- Deploying as a cloud-based web service for HR automation.
