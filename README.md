# Introduction
This project introduces an AI-Powered Resume Classifier that automatically analyzes resumes in PDF format, extracts the text, and classifies them into predefined categories using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The system is deployed with an interactive Streamlit application, allowing users to upload resumes and instantly receive classification results with probabilities for different categories.
